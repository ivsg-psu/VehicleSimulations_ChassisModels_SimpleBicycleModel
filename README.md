# VehicleSimulations_ChassisModels_SimpleBicycleModel
This is a repo for code for the simple bicycle model in MATLAB / Simulink 
including three forms:

  1) state-space, 
  2) transfer function, and 
  3) all-integrator form with linear tire models.

To install: download the files starting with SCRIPT and MODEL. This was
built and tested with R2020b, so if you are using earlier versions, be 
sure to edit the script and change the model name accordingly. Backward-
compatible versions (R2019b an R2013a) are provided if one is using older 
versions of MATLAB/Simulink.
